        <h2> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC">ENIAC-1946</a>  </h2> 
        <p> ENIAC or Electronic Numerical Integrator and computor, built during WII by the United states. It was the first programmable, general purpose computer. John Mauchly, J. Presper Eckert Jr., and  their colleagues at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering led a government-funded project to build an all-electronic computer. Work began early 1943, under the contract of the army and under direction of Herman Goldstine. It lacked some features that would make it a general useful machine. It used a plug bourd to communicate information to the devise. The problem of this was that it took days to rewire the device to fix a new problem.  The ENIAC was huge! It took up 50 by 30 foot basement of the Moore School. Due to its size and all the components, it was the most complex machine at the time. The computer ran continually and emitted a vast amount of heat; It needed its own air conditioning unit.
